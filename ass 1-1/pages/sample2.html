            <p style="width: 900px;text-align: justify;">Daenerys Targaryen is portrayed by Emilia Clarke. She is the exiled princess of the Targaryen dynasty. She and her brother Viserys were smuggled to Essos during the end of Robert's Rebellion. For seventeen years, she has been under her volatile brother's care. In exchange for an army, Viserys marries her to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo. When Drogo dies, Daenerys uses his funeral pyre to birth three dragons. She later conquers and rules over Slaver's Bay with a large army, eventually defeating the slave masters with her dragons. She leaves the region behind for Westeros, however, in a bid to reclaim her birthright: the Iron Throne. Upon her arrival in Westeros, she meets with Jon Snow, the King in the North, who convinces her to defeat the White Walkers before pressing her claim to the throne. The pair soon fall in love. In Westeros, she loses numerous friends and discovers that the people do not support her claim, while two of her dragons perish. Faced with no option but to rule through fear, she uses her last dragon, Drogon, to destroy King's Landing and take the Iron Throne by force. She is assassinated by Jon Snow in the aftermath.</p>
